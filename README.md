# Mobile Price Prediction Project

![Mobile Price Prediction](insert_image_url_here)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a mobile price prediction project. The aim of this project is to predict the prices of Samsung mobile phones based on various features using two different machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression and Random Forest. The project involves data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mobile-price-prediction.git
cd mobile-price-prediction
```

2. Open Jupyter Notebooks to explore and run the project notebooks:

```
jupyter notebook
```

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps are implemented in the `data_preprocessing.py` module. It handles data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.

## Feature Engineering

The `feature_engineering.py` module contains the code for feature engineering. It involves selecting relevant features, scaling numerical features, and transforming categorical variables.

## Model Training

Two different machine learning models are used for price prediction: Linear Regression and Random Forest. The model training code is available in `linear_regression_model.py` and `random_forest_model.py`, respectively.

## Evaluation

The `evaluation.py` module provides functions to evaluate the performance of the trained models. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are calculated.

## Results

The results and visualizations generated during the analysis are available in the Jupyter Notebooks present in the `notebooks` directory.
